              Previously, I worked in the research industry and the skills I acquired there proved
              highly transferable to my current activities. For example, with my research and
              planning skills, I was able to reduce the upfront cost of using new technologies

                I’m a full-stack developer with a solid foundation in JavaScript, React, Node,
                Express, SQL, and other technologies. As I’ve applied this knowledge to my projects,
                I’ve grown as a developer and I’ve raised my standards for what’s expected of any
                software.

                Currently, I’m based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and I’m working full-time as a freelance
                web developer. In this role, I’ve had an opportunity to learn from senior developers
                and build products written in maintainable, scalable, and easily understandable
                code.
