          Previously, I worked in the consulting industry and the skills I
          acquired there proved highly transferable to my current activities.
          For example, with my research and planning skills, I was able to
          reduce the upfront cost of using new technologies

            I’m a full-stack developer with a solid foundation in JavaScript,
            React, Node, Express, SQL, and other technologies. As I’ve applied
            this knowledge to my projects, I’ve grown as a developer and I’ve
            raised my standards for what’s expected of any software. <br />
            <br /> Currently, I’m based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and I’m working
            full-time as a freelance web developer. In this role, I’ve had an
            opportunity to learn from senior developers and build products
            written in maintainable, scalable, and easily understandable code.
